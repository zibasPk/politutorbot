# Telegram Tutor Bot
The project consists of a telegram bot to facilitate the work of the tutoring administration office, it al-lows an easy and intuitive way for students in need, to look for, and reserve a match with a peer-to-peer tutor.
The Idea of doing a bot came from a series of exchanges between the tutoring secretariat and the PoliNetwork student association. It was decided that the task could be assigned to a student who was supposed to do the “Telegram Bot” project with Professor Giovanni Agosta.
